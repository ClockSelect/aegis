This is an attempt to write an open-source customizable firmware for GeekVape Aegis Legend modbox.

I'm still in the process of retro-engineering; the file notes.txt show my advancement.
I'm still missing the function of many of the pins of the MCU; any help would be welcome.
I'd apreciate if someone who has desassembled the box could send me high-res pictures of both sides of the PCB.

Thanks in advance to everyone; any help would be appreciated.
