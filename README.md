This is an attempt to write an open-source customizable firmware for GeekVape Aegis Legend modbox.

This project is in very early stages of developpement and I can't really ensure that it'll be achieved one day. For now, I do not recommend uploading the firmware to any box. It may just be dangerous. For this reason, the binary is not yet available.

# help needed

I'd really appreciate if someone could tell me what the pins 16 (PF.4) and 45 (PB.1) of the MCU are used for. PF.4 seems to be battery-related, and PF.1 display-related, but as long as I do not have a dead box to disassemble to look where they track to, it is still a bit mysterious.
